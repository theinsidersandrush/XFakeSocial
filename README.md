# XFakeSocial: Spoofin' da X
![Letter killed a bird](https://github.com/theinsidersandrush/XFakeSocial/assets/87752859/205e636d-c629-458b-9309-056c455acb08)
The X app but actually not. __Not affiliated with X Corp, Elon Musk or the app itself.__

## What is this?
Twitter changed its name and brand into X. The links for Elon's online banking known as X.com. [X.com](http://x.com) now redirects back to [Twitter](https://twitter.com). So, when I look for the so-called X on APK websites, their Android version of Twitter reached version 10.0.0. The android package still referred as com.twitter.android. So, in (maybe the near future), com.twitter.android might be named as com.x.android. Hence, that's why this repository exist... Creating a spoof app that might not be Twitter/X actually...
